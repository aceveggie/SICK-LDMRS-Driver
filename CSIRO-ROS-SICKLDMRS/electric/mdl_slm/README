MDL SLM Driver

CSIRO 2011

David Haddon and Fred Pauling

This is a quick hack driver.. do not use for production.

A basic ROS driver for MDL's Scanning Laser Module (SLM).  
see: http://www.mdl.co.uk/en/scanning-laser-module-slm--15117

Publishes sensor_msgs.LaserScan messages on the 'slm_laser' topic. 
Each message includes points from one UDP packet only - which is less than one full revolution.

Usage:

rosrun mdlslm mdlslm.py [-rate=<10>] [__name=<slm_laser>] [-port=<30>] [-ip=<128.2.0.201>] [-frame=</slm>] [-lo_res=0] [-visible=0]

rate    :  Spin rate in Hz, should be between 1-20
__name  :  Ros topic name
port    :  Laser UDP port  (this will not change the laser!)
ip      :  IP address of laser (once again.. will not change the laser settings)
frame   :  Frame ID for LaserScan topic
lo_res  :  set to 1 to use 10th degree increments, defaults to 100th degree
visible :  Turn on the red visible laser
