  <description brief="small">

     SMALL is a C++ library defining and implementing common geometric and 
     mathematical functionality required for robotics applications.
     SMALL consists of two major parts: a linear algebra library 
     (matrices and vectors) and a spatial math library (poses and transformations).
	 It is just a collection of C++ headers and not a binary library.
